### "Most networked programs you use are probably using centralized or client-server model. Under this model, one machine is a trusted authority (server), and every other machine is a relatively untrusted member of the network (client) that relies on the server for coordination, authentication, and authorization."

## Everyone's a peer.

### "P2P publishing enables people to publish content and information to the web from their personal computers without the need of server or centralized platform. This fundamentally changes the relationship people have to the internet by breaking the client server hierarchy and opens the realm of self publishing to everyone."

## dat://
---
## dat:// is kind of like file://
---
# Pro
---
### ▪ cannot be shut down
### ▪ works well offline
### ▪ collectively owned
### ▪ scales very-well
### ▪ no authentication
---
# Contra
---
### ▪ slower (or no) network updates
### ▪ no peers = not available
---
## The P2P Web embodies 3 principles:
---
## ▪ Anybody can be a server.
## ▪ Multiple computers can serve the same site.
## ▪ There is no back end.

### "Once integrated into a browser, these principles enable users to publish independently of services, and move between applications freely."
