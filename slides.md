### The P2P Web embodies 3 principles:
<div class="mb2"></div>

### ▪ Anybody can be a server.
### ▪ Multiple computers can serve the same site.
### ▪ There is no back end.

##### <div class="mt2 tar"><a href="http://pfrazee.github.io/blog/what-is-the-p2p-web">Paul Frazee ― What is the P2P Web?</a></div>
---
### "Once integrated into a browser, these principles enable users to publish independently of services, and move between applications freely."

# Pro
---
### ▪ Cannot be shut down.
### ▪ Works well offline.
### ▪ Scales very-well.
### ▪ Authentication is not required.
---
# Contra
---
### ▪ No peers = Not available
### ▪ Your computer is open to strangers (kind of).
### ▪ Trust is necessary.
---
## Beaker Browser
---
## Offline
---
## It's like a no man's land for sites.
---
## Applications on the P2P web:
---
### 1. Don't use a centralized database or user accounts.
---
### 2. Store your data locally in your filesystem.
---
### 3. You grant them read/write permission.
